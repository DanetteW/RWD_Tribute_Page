            <h1 id="title">A Tribute To My Brother</h1>

            <p id="tribute-info">
                Though the love between siblings will never be perfect, I can't imagine living my life without my little brother.</p>

            <p>Whether we bicker or have full on arguments, it will never outweigh the love and yearning I have for him. He is my every reason for waking up in the mornings. To somehow find a way of making up all the time we have lost, is my daily goal.
                Together we shall build a future the same way we are constantly building our present. No one can take that away from us. </p>
            <p>If I had to list the reasons why he deserves an Oscar, not for his extraordinary performance in some movie, but rather for being one hell of a brother and for never backing down to what this life throws at him.</p>
